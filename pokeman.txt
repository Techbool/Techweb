Ash Ketchum, his yellow pet Pikachu, and his human friends explore a world of powerful creatures. Ten-year-old Ash aspires to be the greatest Pokémon (pocket monster) trainer in the world. To do this, he enlists the help of many friends, and his own Pokémon, Pikachu.

Pokémon: Black & White, previously known as Pokémon: Best Wishes(!), is a continuation of the Pokémon Anime series, in which the main character, Ash Ketchum, goes through the Pokémon world, originally known as Electronic Monster World. In this world, there are different animals, or Pokémon, and they all are versions of animals and objects that are found here in Earth. These harmless Pokémon (short for Pocket Monster(s)), are forced to fight each other, often to the death. Anyway, Ash goes through a region known as Unova, and meets different people (not to be named due to potential spoilers), and go through a magical Pokémon adventure, on a quest to become the world's greatest Pokémon Master. Aaaaand that's pretty much it.
